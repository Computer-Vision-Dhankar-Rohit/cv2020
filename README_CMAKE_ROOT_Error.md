##### CMAKE installed and upgraded to latest version according to instructions on their official site here - 
- https://cmake.org/download/

###### Now calling CMAKE to build OpenCV gives error as below - 
```
CMake Error: Could not find CMAKE_ROOT !!!
CMake has most likely not been installed correctly.
Modules directory not found in
/usr/local/share/cmake-3.10
